# pic2slide
One of my biochemistry professors did not provide slideshows to students so I took pictures of each slide and automated the slideshow production process in python
This is a program written in python that will take a folder of photos as input and would output a PowerPoint slide show with each slide as a photo
This saved me ~12h of drag and dropping photos into PowerPoint over the course of the fall semester.
